Hall effect and TMR are both magnetic sensing technologies used in gaming keyboards. They enable the same features — adjustable actuation, rapid trigger, analog input — but differ in how they read the magnet's position. This article breaks down where each technology wins and where it doesn't matter.

If you haven't read them yet, the [What Is Hall Effect?](/learn/what-is-hall-effect) and [What Is TMR?](/learn/what-is-tmr) articles cover each technology individually in more depth.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Hall Effect | TMR |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **How it works** | Measures magnetic field strength | Measures resistance change via electron tunneling |
| **Position resolution** | ~0.1mm effective | ~0.05mm effective |
| **Temperature stability** | Good (with firmware compensation) | Better (inherently stable) |
| **Signal-to-noise ratio** | Good | Higher |
| **Rapid trigger** | Yes | Yes |
| **Adjustable actuation** | Yes (typically 0.1-4.0mm) | Yes (potentially finer minimum) |
| **Analog input** | Yes | Yes (higher resolution) |
| **Switch ecosystem** | Established (Gateron, Lekker, etc.) | Growing |
| **Price range** | $80-200 | $100-250 |
| **Software maturity** | Mature | Varies |

## Where TMR Wins

### Precision at Extreme Settings

If you set your actuation point to 0.1mm and rapid trigger sensitivity to the minimum, TMR's higher resolution gives you more reliable key registration. At these extremes, hall effect sensors occasionally misread due to noise, requiring firmware filtering that adds a tiny amount of latency. TMR's cleaner signal means less filtering needed.

This matters to a small percentage of competitive players who push their settings to the absolute limit. If your actuation point is 0.5mm or higher, the difference is negligible.

### Temperature Consistency

Hall effect sensors' output drifts slightly with temperature. Quality HE keyboards compensate for this in firmware, but the compensation adds processing overhead and can occasionally lag behind rapid temperature changes (like going from a cold room to a heated tournament venue). TMR sensors are more inherently stable.

### Theoretical Longevity

Both technologies are effectively wear-free since there's no physical contact. However, TMR sensors are less susceptible to long-term magnetic degradation. In practice, both will outlast the rest of the keyboard.

## Where Hall Effect Wins

### Ecosystem and Variety

Hall effect has a multi-year head start. More keyboard brands, more switch options, more case designs, more community knowledge. If you want a specific layout, colorway, or brand, you're far more likely to find it in HE than TMR right now.

### Price-to-Performance

The best HE keyboards are cheaper than the best TMR keyboards, and the performance gap doesn't justify the price gap for most users. A $120 Wooting 80HE or DrunkDeer A75 with hall effect will outperform a poorly-implemented $180 TMR board.

### Software Maturity

Wooting's Wootility, Razer's Synapse, and other established HE software platforms have years of iteration behind them. TMR keyboard software is often first-generation, with rougher interfaces and fewer features. The sensor tech matters less than the software that controls it.

### Community Support

Larger user base means more troubleshooting resources, firmware guides, switch comparisons, and community modifications. If you run into an issue with an HE keyboard, someone else probably already solved it.

## Where It Doesn't Matter

### Actual Gameplay Impact

In blind tests, competitive players cannot consistently tell the difference between a well-tuned HE keyboard and a well-tuned TMR keyboard. The marginal precision improvement doesn't translate to measurable gameplay advantage for the vast majority of players.

### Typing Experience

The typing feel is determined by the switch mechanism (spring weight, stem design, housing material), not the sensing technology. A hall effect switch and a TMR switch with identical mechanical designs feel identical to type on.

### Durability

Both are effectively immortal from a sensing perspective. Neither will wear out from normal use within the keyboard's practical lifespan.

## The Real Decision Framework

The sensor technology should be low on your priority list when choosing a keyboard. Here's what actually matters more:

1. **Layout** — Does the keyboard have the right size and layout for you?
2. **Build quality** — Does it feel solid? Are the stabilizers good?
3. **Software** — Is the configuration software usable and well-maintained?
4. **Switch feel** — Does the switch weight and travel feel right for your use?
5. **Price** — Are you getting good value?
6. **Sensor technology** — All else being equal, TMR has a slight edge

If two keyboards match on points 1-5 and one has TMR while the other has HE, pick the TMR one. But don't compromise on layout, build quality, or software just to get TMR.

## Bottom Line

TMR is objectively better technology measured in isolation. In a complete keyboard, it's one factor among many, and rarely the most important one. Buy the best keyboard for your needs. If that happens to have TMR, great. If it's HE, you're not missing out on anything that matters in practice.
