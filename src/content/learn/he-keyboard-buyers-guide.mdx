You've decided you want a hall effect keyboard. The technology articles make sense. Rapid trigger sounds useful. Now you need to pick one. This guide walks through the decisions that actually matter when choosing an HE keyboard, in order of importance.

If you're not sure whether you want an HE keyboard in the first place, start with [What Is a Hall Effect Keyboard?](/learn/what-is-hall-effect) and [Rapid Trigger Explained](/learn/rapid-trigger-explained).

## Decision 1: Layout

This matters more than any other spec. If the keyboard doesn't have the right layout, nothing else matters.

### 60% (Compact)

- Keys: ~61 (letters, numbers, modifiers only)
- Missing: Function row, arrow keys, nav cluster
- Best for: Maximum desk space, clean aesthetic, players who've memorized Fn layer shortcuts
- Watch out for: If you use F-keys or arrows regularly, the Fn layer gets old fast

### 65% (Compact with Arrows)

- Keys: ~67 (60% + dedicated arrow keys + a few nav keys)
- Missing: Function row
- Best for: Players who want compact but can't give up arrow keys
- The "safe compact" choice

### 75% (Compact with Function Row)

- Keys: ~82 (65% + function row)
- Missing: Full nav cluster (Home, End, PgUp, PgDn are usually Fn-layer)
- Best for: Most gamers. Compact enough for low-sens mouse sweeps, complete enough for everything else
- The most popular layout in HE keyboards right now

### TKL / 80% (Tenkeyless)

- Keys: ~87 (everything except numpad)
- Missing: Numpad
- Best for: Players who use nav cluster keys, typists who want a familiar layout
- Slightly larger than 75% but more traditional

### Full Size

- Keys: ~104 (everything)
- Best for: Data entry, number-heavy workflows, people who don't want to compromise
- Rare in the HE space — most manufacturers focus on 75% and TKL

**My recommendation:** 75% is the sweet spot for most people. You get the function row, compact enough for gaming, and the widest selection of HE options.

## Decision 2: Build Quality and Feel

Specs don't tell you how a keyboard feels. Two keyboards can have identical sensor technology and completely different build quality. Here's what to evaluate:

### Case Material
- **Plastic** — Lighter, cheaper. Can flex or creak. Fine for most people.
- **Aluminum** — Heavier, premium feel, no flex. Significant price premium ($50-100+ more).
- **Mixed** — Aluminum top plate with plastic bottom. Good compromise.

### Mounting Style
- **Tray mount** — The PCB screws directly to standoffs in the case. Firm, can feel stiff. Most budget boards.
- **Gasket mount** — The plate sits on rubber gaskets between plate and case. Softer, more cushioned typing feel. Mid-range and up.
- **Top mount** — Plate attaches to the top of the case. Firm but slightly softer than tray mount. Less common in HE.

Gasket mount generally produces the best typing feel. If you type a lot alongside gaming, prioritize it.

### Stabilizers
The stabilizers (on Space, Shift, Enter, Backspace) make or break a keyboard's sound and feel. Rattly, mushy stabilizers ruin otherwise good boards. Check reviews specifically for stabilizer quality — it's often the weakest point on budget HE keyboards.

### Keycaps
- **ABS** — Smooth, shiny over time. Thinner feel and higher-pitched sound. Most stock keycaps.
- **PBT** — Textured, resistant to shine. Deeper sound. Premium feel.
- **Double-shot vs dye-sub** — Both work. Double-shot legends never fade. Dye-sub legends are printed into the plastic.

HE keyboards use standard MX-compatible keycap stems, so aftermarket keycaps work fine. Don't let stock keycaps be a dealbreaker if the board is otherwise good.

## Decision 3: Software Quality

This is where many HE keyboards fail. The sensor technology can be excellent while the software is terrible. Software controls all the features that make HE keyboards worth buying.

### What Good Software Looks Like
- Per-key actuation adjustment with real-time preview
- Rapid trigger configuration with sensitivity and dead zone controls
- Profile system for switching between gaming and typing settings
- Analog input configuration with curve editor
- Key remapping and macro support
- Firmware updates delivered through the software

### Red Flags
- Browser-based only (no native app) — can be fine but often limited
- Requires constant internet connection
- No per-key configuration (only global actuation setting)
- No firmware update mechanism
- Software not available on your OS (some only support Windows)

### Brands Known for Good Software
- **Wooting** (Wootility) — Best in class, community-driven development
- **Razer** (Synapse) — Full-featured but heavy, requires account login
- **Keychron** (VIA-compatible) — Open-source, community standard
- **DrunkDeer** — Basic but functional, improving steadily

Don't buy a keyboard assuming the software will improve later. Evaluate it based on its current state.

## Decision 4: Rapid Trigger Implementation

Not all rapid trigger is created equal. The feature exists across HE keyboards, but the quality of implementation varies:

### Minimum Sensitivity
How low can you set the rapid trigger sensitivity? Most boards go to 0.1mm. Some cheaper implementations only go to 0.3mm. For competitive play, you want at least 0.2mm minimum.

### Consistency
Does the rapid trigger behave identically on every key? Cheaper implementations can have key-to-key variance where some keys trigger slightly differently than others. Hard to evaluate without testing, but reviews often catch this.

### Latency
Some firmware implementations add processing delay to filter noise. A 1ms difference is imperceptible. A 5ms difference is noticeable to competitive players. Check for latency tests in reviews.

### SOCD Handling
How does the keyboard handle simultaneous opposing key presses (A + D at the same time)? Options are "last input wins," "neutral," and "first input wins." Make sure the keyboard supports the SOCD mode your games allow — Counter-Strike 2 specifically banned "last input wins" SOCD.

## Decision 5: Switch Type

HE keyboards have fewer switch options than mechanical, but there are still choices:

### Spring Weight
- **Light (30-40g)** — Fast, easy to press, more accidental actuations
- **Medium (45-55g)** — Standard, good all-around
- **Heavy (60g+)** — Deliberate presses, good for typing, slower for gaming

### Switch Brand
- **Gateron** — Most common in HE keyboards, reliable
- **Lekker (Wooting)** — Proprietary to Wooting, well-regarded
- **Geon** — Used in some premium boards
- **Custom in-house** — Many brands develop their own HE switches

### Hot-Swap
Most modern HE keyboards support hot-swap within the HE ecosystem. You can swap Gateron HE switches for different weight Gateron HE switches, but you cannot put Cherry MX switches in an HE socket. Make sure the board is hot-swap if you think you might want to change switches later.

## Decision 6: Price

HE keyboards span a wide range. Here's what you get at each tier:

### Budget ($60-90)
- Plastic case, tray mount
- Basic but functional software
- Rapid trigger included
- Examples: DrunkDeer A75, Attack Shark boards
- **Good for:** First-time HE buyers, budget-conscious gamers

### Mid-Range ($100-160)
- Better build quality (often gasket mount)
- More polished software
- PBT keycaps, better stabilizers
- Examples: Wooting 80HE, Keychron boards
- **Good for:** Most people. Best value tier.

### Premium ($160-250+)
- Aluminum case, gasket mount
- Top-tier software and firmware
- Premium keycaps and stabilizers
- Optional extras (screen, knob, wireless)
- Examples: Razer Huntsman V3 Pro, Meletrix Boog75 HE
- **Good for:** Enthusiasts who want the best build quality

**My recommendation:** The mid-range tier ($100-160) is where the best value lives. You get significantly better build quality and software than budget boards, without the diminishing returns of the premium tier.

## Quick Decision Flowchart

1. **What layout do you need?** Narrow your options to that layout.
2. **What's your budget?** Filter to keyboards in your range.
3. **Check software quality.** Eliminate boards with poor or missing software.
4. **Read reviews for build quality.** Pay attention to stabilizers and case flex.
5. **Check rapid trigger specs.** Ensure minimum sensitivity meets your needs.
6. **Pick the one that looks best to you.** At this point, remaining options are all solid — go with the one you'll enjoy using.
