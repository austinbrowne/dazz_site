    <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
    <p class="text-zinc-400"><em>Last updated: February 2026</em></p>

    <h2>How This Site Earns Revenue</h2>
    <p>
      Dazztrazak.com is a participant in affiliate programs with various retailers and brands. This means that when you click on certain links on this site and make a purchase, I may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Means for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No extra cost:</strong> You pay the same price whether you use my affiliate link or not.</li>
      <li><strong>Honest opinions:</strong> Affiliate relationships never influence my reviews or recommendations. I review products the same way regardless of affiliate status.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Pages containing affiliate links are clearly marked with a disclosure notice near the links.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which Products Have Affiliate Links?</h2>
    <p>
      Not all products I review have affiliate links. Some products are purchased directly, provided as review units, or from brands without affiliate programs. When a product does have an affiliate link, it is clearly labeled.
    </p>

    <h2>Review Units</h2>
    <p>
      Some products are provided by manufacturers for review purposes. Whether a product is purchased or provided as a review unit is disclosed in each review. Receiving a review unit does not guarantee a positive review.
    </p>

    <h2>FTC Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      This disclosure is provided in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials. If you have questions about this policy, please <a href="/work-with-me">contact me</a>.
